# 📊 Data Repositories, ETL, and Big Data – Learning Notes

## 🧠 Overview

This document covers key foundational concepts in data engineering and analytics, 
including data repositories,
ETL processes, data pipelines, and Big Data technologies.

## 📁 What is a Data Repository?

A **Data Repository** is a centralized location where data is collected, organized, and stored. It allows for:

- Reporting
- Analytics
- Archival and historical reference

---

## 🗃️ Types of Data Repositories

### 1. **Databases**
- Can be **relational (SQL)** or **non-relational (NoSQL)**.
- Follow specific organizational principles.
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra.
- Support data querying, organizing, and retrieval.

### 2. **Data Warehouses**
- Centralized storage systems that **consolidate incoming data**.
- Designed for **analytics and reporting**.
- Examples: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake.

### 3. **Data Marts**
- Subsets of data warehouses.
- Focused on specific business functions or departments.
- Provide **faster access** to relevant data.

### 4. **Data Lakes**
- Store vast amounts of **structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data**.
- Keep data in its **native format** until needed.
- Examples: AWS S3 (with Glue or Athena), Azure Data Lake.

### 5. **Big Data Stores**
- Built to manage and process **large-scale distributed datasets**.
- Support high-volume, high-velocity data.
- Examples: Apache Hadoop HDFS, Google Cloud Bigtable.

## 🔄 ETL: Extract, Transform, Load

The **ETL process** automates the conversion of raw data into analysis-ready data.

### 🔹 Extract
- Pull data from one or more source systems.

### 🔹 Transform
- Clean, validate, and reformat the raw data.
- Common transformations:
  - Removing duplicates
  - Normalizing formats
  - Handling missing values

### 🔹 Load
- Move the transformed data into a data repository like:
  - A Data Warehouse
  - A Data Lake
  - A Database

## 🚰 Data Pipelines

- A **Data Pipeline** refers to the full journey of data from source to destination.
- Includes ETL, monitoring, and orchestration.
- May include real-time or batch data flows.
- Tools: Apache Airflow, dbt, Luigi, Kafka.

---

## 📈 Big Data

**Big Data** refers to extremely large data sets that are:

- **High Volume** – Massive amounts of data
- **High Velocity** – Rapid generation and flow of data
- **High Variety** – Multiple types and formats (text, images, logs, etc.)

### ⚙️ Big Data Tools & Frameworks
- **Apache Hadoop** – Distributed storage and processing
- **Apache Hive** – SQL-like querying on Hadoop
- **Apache Spark** – Fast in-memory data processing engine
